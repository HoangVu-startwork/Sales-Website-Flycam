            <h4>Where Agility Meets Toughness</h4>
            <p>Compact and lightweight, DJI Avata is nimble in tight spaces. 
            Every aspect of its design was made for you to be bold. 
            The built-in propeller guard means that if Avata comes in contact with an object, 
            it can bounce back, stay in the air, and can keep on flying.</p>
